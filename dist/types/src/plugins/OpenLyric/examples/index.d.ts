/**
 * The bundled Open Lyric example songs, as raw Open Lyric markdown.
 *
 * Two ways in, one module. The notation plugin's data (`open-lyric_ol_editor.ts`)
 * wraps these strings in `{ id, fileName, title, description, content }` records
 * so they reach a page's Examples menu; this barrel is the other way — a host
 * that wants to SEED a surface's initial content rather than offer the song in a
 * menu imports the text directly (`new OpenLyric({ value: … })`), which is what
 * the standalone preview and editor page entries do with the Khmer counterparts
 * in `src/plugins/km_KH/examples/index.ts`.
 *
 * Both paths read this module, so each song's text is bundled once.
 *
 * The constants are named after the songs, not after their file numbers: the
 * `exampleN-…` filename is an ordering detail of the Examples menu, while the
 * name a host writes in its own source should say what it is seeding. The
 * matching menu `id` is noted on each doc comment for the record.
 *
 * NOTE: `example-placeholder-song.md` is deliberately absent — it is a unit-test
 * fixture (`OpenLyric.display.test.ts`, `OpenLyric.reset.test.ts`), not a
 * shipped example, and the plugin data does not list it either.
